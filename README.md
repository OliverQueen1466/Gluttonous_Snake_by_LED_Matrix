# Gluttonous_Snake_by_LED_Matrix

The project is to run Gluttonous Snake on FDE develop board. Four button will ctrl the move of snake on a 16*16 LED matrix and a digital clock is to record the time . The interface is through SMIMS. 
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZFWq8M31To&ab_channel=oliverttt) shows the interface when running the whole project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the project and other tools to build, test and push 
- FDE FPGA deveop board
- SMIMS/VeriInstrument

### Installing

Linux:

    git clone https://github.com/OliverQueen1466/Gluttonous_Snake_by_LED_Matrix.git


## Running the project

Explain how to run the whole procedure of project

### Testbench Simulation

Testbench is also included for function verifivation before using the real board.

### Bitstream Generation

use the VeriInstrument to generate bitstream from tested RTL code.

### Download to the board

## Acknowledgments

  - Prof. Wang from FPGA honor class provides the FDE develop board.
